    Began developing blogging platform using web.py. 
    For now, uses a hacked-together text file to store post info.
    Nothing fancy yet; just a way to learn web.py.

05.24.2011: 
    Added CSS. Added content hide/show using jQuery.
    Added function to view individual posts.

05.25.2011:
    Added new post function. 
    Templated the pages.
    Tried thinking of other ways to design the 'blog' class.
    Bug in 'functions.js', only looks at last character. 
        So unless I restrict the blog roll to a count of less than 
        9, it will have this bug. It's fixable though, 
        but it's 1AM, so I'm going to bed.

05.26.2011:
    Fixed the bug in 'functions.js'

05.27.2011:
    Made stylesheets and pages more templated.

06.04.2011:    
    Created postscontrollers.py, contains the object Posts_Controller, which
        will be an easy-access to the file containing all the posts. 
    Created blogpost.py, contains the object Blog_Post, which is an object 
        that represents a blog post. 
    Modified blog.py and blog.html to use the new structure.
