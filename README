05.23.2011: 	Began developing blogging platform using web.py. 
		For now, uses a hacked-together text file to store post info.
		Nothing fancy yet; just a way to learn web.py.

05.24.2011:	Added CSS. Added content hide/show using jQuery.
		Added function to view individual posts.

05.25.2011:	Added new post function. 
		Templated the pages.
		Tried thinking of other ways to design the 'blog' class.
		Bug in 'functions.js', only looks at last character. So unless I restrict the blog roll to a count of less than 9, it will have this bug. It's fixable though, but it's 1am, so I'm going to bed.

05.26.2011:	Fixed the bug in 'functions.js'

05.27.2011:	Made stylesheets and pages more templated.
